JavaScript(07-12-2025):
-----------------------
JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages.

HTML - It is the markup language that we use to srtucture and give meaning to our web content.

CSS - It is the language of style rules that we used to apply styling to our HTML cotent.

Syntax Parser
--------------
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and it its grammar is valid .

Lexical Environment
---------------------
Where something sits physically in the code you write.

function(){
    ksldkald
    asdkladkl
    asldklsd1
}

Execution Context
------------------
a wrapper to help manage the code that is running.

lexical 1
lexical 2
lexical 3

for e.g Thre are lots of lexical Environment which one is currently running is managed by executation context.

Nama/ Value pairs
------------------
name : Value

A name which maps to a unique value(name: 'Sntanu')

Object
----------
A collection of there name value pairs.

Global environment and Global Object
--------------------------------------
When ever code is running in javascript it runs inside an executation context.

Execution Context(Global)
-------------------------
Global Object // javascript execution engine creating these two things for us.
This

Global -  Not inside the function

Hoisting
-----------
When you declare variable and function in javascript, the executation engine sets up a memory
space for variable and function.

1. If it is a variable it will keep that variable in memory and assign 
a default value called undefined.

2. If it is a function it will copy entire function and keeps in memory.

undefined
-----------
It is a special value in javascript which takes up memory space.

Warning : Never ever declare a variable undefined, bacause it is difficult to find value is 'undefined' bacause
we set it or javascript executation engine set it up.

Prmitive Types
---------------
A type of data that represents a single value is call Prmitive data type.

1. undefined - This represent lack of existance(we should never use This)
2. null -  This represents lack of existance(we can set a variable to this)
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Number - Integer/ floating type(decimal)
5. String- a sequence or characters
6. Symbol - used in ES6

Anything which is not Prmitive is an object in javascript

object
function
array
Date
RegularExpression

Functions
----------
It is a block of code wrapped around flower brackets and invocated later.
function functionname(){

}

1. Regular Functions
2. Anonymous Functions
3. Immediately invoked function(IIFS)

First Class Functions
-----------------------
1. Can be invoked
2. Assign to a variable
3. passed as a parameter

Advantages with IIFS
---------------------
1. Will not create unnecessary global variables and functions.
2. Functions and variables defined don't conflict

arrays
-------
An array is an object that can store a collection of items.
It is useful when you want to store a large amount of data.

var students = ["Santanu", "Sidhanta", "Sipun", "Sandeep"]

var people = new Array ("Uma", "Swathi", "Sipun", "Sandeep")

In javascript arrays are object types with special constructor.

var array = new Array(3) - length
var array = new Array (100000) - length will not create any memory

Array insex start from zero

Closure
-------
Inner functions having access to the variables of outer functions.

Bind vs Call vs Apply
-----------------------
bind - sets 'this' keyword and creates a copy of that function

call - sets 'This' keyword and execute the function Immediately and doesnot 
create a new copy of the function

apply - sets 'This' keyword, similar to call

Class
------
JavaScript is a prototype-based language which contains no class statement such as is found in c# or Java.

JavaScript uses function as a class.

e.g. function Student(){}

instance
--------
To create instance of the class

function Person(){

}

var person1 = new Person();
var person2 = new Person();

constructor
------------
 function Order(){
    consle.log('Order is placed')
 }

 var order = new Order(); ||Order() is called constructor

 Properties
 -----------
 function customer(gender){
    this.gender = gender
 }

 var customer1 = new Customer('Male')
 var customer2 = new Customer('Male')

prototype
----------
The prototype is an object that is associated with every function and objects by default in javascript.

This is special type of object to which additional Properties and methods can be attached.
