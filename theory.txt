JavaScript(07-12-2025):
-----------------------
JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages.

HTML - It is the markup language that we use to srtucture and give meaning to our web content.

CSS - It is the language of style rules that we used to apply styling to our HTML cotent.

Syntax Parser
--------------
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and it its grammar is valid .

Lexical Environment
---------------------
Where something sits physically in the code you write.

function(){
    ksldkald
    asdkladkl
    asldklsd1
}

Execution Context
------------------
a wrapper to help manage the code that is running.

lexical 1
lexical 2
lexical 3

for e.g Thre are lots of lexical Environment which one is currently running is managed by executation context.

Nama/ Value pairs
------------------
name : Value

A name which maps to a unique value(name: 'Sntanu')

Object
----------
A collection of there name value pairs.

Global environment and Global Object
--------------------------------------
When ever code is running in javascript it runs inside an executation context.

Execution Context(Global)
-------------------------
Global Object // javascript execution engine creating these two things for us.
This

Global -  Not inside the function

Hoisting
-----------
When you declare variable and function in javascript, the executation engine sets up a memory
space for variable and function.

1. If it is a variable it will keep that variable in memory and assign 
a default value called undefined.

2. If it is a function it will copy entire function and keeps in memory.

undefined
-----------
It is a special value in javascript which takes up memory space.

Warning : Never ever declare a variable undefined, bacause it is difficult to find value is 'undefined' bacause
we set it or javascript executation engine set it up.

Prmitive Types
---------------
A type of data that represents a single value is call Prmitive data type.

1. undefined - This represent lack of existance(we should never use This)
2. null -  This represents lack of existance(we can set a variable to this)
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Number - Integer/ floating type(decimal)
5. String- a sequence or characters
6. Symbol - used in ES6

Anything which is not Prmitive is an object in javascript

object
function
array
Date
RegularExpression

Functions
----------
It is a block of code wrapped around flower brackets and invocated later.
function functionname(){

}

1. Regular Functions
2. Anonymous Functions
3. Immediately invoked function(IIFS)

First Class Functions
-----------------------
1. Can be invoked
2. Assign to a variable
3. passed as a parameter

Advantages with IIFS
---------------------
1. Will not create unnecessary global variables and functions.
2. Functions and variables defined don't conflict
